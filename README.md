# CUDA-kernels

This repository is dedicated to recording and maintaining a set of commonly used CUDA kernels.  
The goal is to provide simple and easy-to-understand implementations for reference and practice.

## Supported Kernels

- **Element Wise Add**
- **Inclusive Prefix Sum**
- **Softmax**
- **ReLu**
- **Sgemm**

This list will be continuously updated as more kernels are added.
